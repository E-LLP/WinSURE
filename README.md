# WinSURE

WinSURE is a reliability analysis program used for calculating upper and
lower bounds on for the operational and death state probabilities for
a large class of semi-Markov models.  The program is especially suited
for the analysis of fault-tolerant reconfigurable systems.  The
calculated bounds are close enough (usually within 5 percent of each
other) for use in reliability studies of ultra-reliable computer
systems. The SURE bounding theorems have algebraic solutions and are
consequently computationally efficient even for large and complex
systems.  SURE can optionally regard a specified parameter as a
variable over a range of values, enabling an automatic sensitivity
analysis.

The WinSURE program is written in Java and has been tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems.
